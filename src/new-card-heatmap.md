**[ calculation ]**

1. Add new cards does not count, learning new cards counts.

1. When the new card interval becomes the next day or later, the number is counted.

1. If the card does not graduate, it will not be counted. If it graduates the next day, it will be counted then.

**[ Noets ]**

1. Color is blue only at this time.

1. This add-on is relatively simple code, so it does not have advanced features like the Review Heatmap. (This add-on is not a Fork or customized version)

1. Old Anki is not supported. (like Anki2.1.35 - 2.1.45)
