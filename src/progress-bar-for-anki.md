**[ üìñ How To Use ]**<br>

**[ Option 01 : BarType tab ]**<br>
The settings window looks like this.<br>

* ![image](https://github.com/shigeyukey/my_addons/assets/124401518/1876997a-c10d-45a6-a85a-2ca9083d0db3)<br>

**[ Target card values 1 - 100 ]**<br>

 Adjusting the target card values will change the bar chunks. It can be used to review 5 cards at a time or 20 cards at a time. The minimum is 1 and the maximum is 100.<br>

* [ 1 ] Value 5<br>

  * ![image](https://github.com/shigeyukey/my_addons/assets/124401518/73254ea2-4a3b-41de-8607-a68304534826)<br>


* [ 2 ] Value 20<br>

**[ Calculation Method ]**<br>

You can change the calculation method of the cards for the progress bar. There are three types.<br>

* **[ 1 ] Count Each Deck (default)**<br>

    * Calculates the progress bar for each deck. It retrieves card data, so cards reviewed on mobile are also calculated. So even after restarting Anki, the reviewed cards' values are retained. The progress bar will advance when a card is answered correctly and the due date is after the next day.<br>

* **[ 2 ] Count All Decks**<br>

    * Cards from all decks are totaled and calculated. Otherwise it is the same as the progress bar [1].<br>

* **[ 3 ] For Filtered Decks**<br>

    * This is automatically used when reviewing with filter decks. It is calculated for each deck, but does not collect data on previous cards. So when you restart Anki, the card data is reset and mobile reviews are not used. This can be used instead of [1] and [2] progress bar when there is a problem.<br>

**[ Show/hide progress bar ]**<br>

 You can hide the progress bar.<br>

* [ 1 ] Hide Large count progress bar<br>
