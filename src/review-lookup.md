This add-on is a customized version of the discontinued add-on <a href="https://github.com/fonol/anki-review-lookup" target="_blank">"Review Lookup"</a>. The original Review Lookup code was developed by <a href="https://github.com/fonol" target="_blank">fonol (prollo, 2022)</a> and credit goes to them, and the idea of Review Lookup was inspired by [Glutanimate (Aristotelis P.)](https://glutanimate.com/), [Pop-up Dictionary](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/153625306).

The original Review Lookup was not broken and did not need to be repaired but it is no longer available for download because it was [discontinued](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1745211643) so I re-uploaded and customized the add-on (GNU Affero General Public License). This customized version has enhanced user interface, added options, and optimized calculations.

### Option

![alt text](<images/Review lookup/06.png>)

The options can be accessed from the gear icon in the tooltip or add-ons tools.

1. Quick Search
    * Quickly search for text by selecting it, no right-click required.
2. Highligt
    * Enable or disable highlighting.
3. Blur nested tooltips.
    * Enable or disable blur when there are multiple tooltips.
4. Max lenght of search text
    * ignore if text is too long.
5. Max Results
    * limit the number of search results.
6. Font size
    * Change font size. If set to 0, it changes automatically.
7. Reset Zoom and Size

Changes to options will not take effect during the review, so you need to finish the review. (Reviewer -> Decks (Home) -> Reviewer)

### Include Decks

![alt text](<images/Review lookup/07.png>)

You can specify which decks to include or exclude from the search. If the search is slow, try reducing the number of too large decks. You can change the checks in bulk by right-clicking.

You need to specify the exact deck that contains the cards, excluding only the parent deck will not exclude cards in the child decks.

### Note

Search may not work well for some languages. (e.g. Japanese, Chinese) If you want to add support for new languages please send me a request.
