This add-on is a customized version of the discontinued add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1745211643" target="_blank">"Review Lookup"</a>, originally created by <a href="https://github.com/fonol" target="_blank">fonol</a> and credit goes to them.

## üìñHow to use
*(These descriptions and images are edited and re-uploaded from the original add-on.)*

![alt text](<images/Review lookup/03.png>)

This provides a functionality similar to the [original Pop-up dictionary add-on](https://web.archive.org/web/20220617015222/https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/153625306).
All credit for the idea goes to the original author.

Basic principle is you select some text during the review, and a little popup appears, that shows you notes from your collection that contain the selected text.

Because Anki's codebase is going through a lot of changes these days, I try to decouple this add-on to a large extent from Anki's code, to ideally keep it working for a long time.

This only uses some hooks of Anki's add-on hook system (which has been there in its current form for quite some time) and uses no external libraries at all.

The add-on creates an in-memory search index at Anki's startup to be able to better rank the search results by their relevancy, which takes about 600ms for 10k notes on my machine. So please keep in mind that while using this add-on, your Anki might start a little slower.

### configuration options

1. `should_highlight`: disable/enable highlighting in search results
1. `blur_nested_tooltips`: disables the blurring effect if you nest multiple tooltips
1. `query.max_length`: if your selected text is longer than this value, no search will be triggered
1. `results.font_size`: sets the font size for the tooltip
1. `results.limit`: determines how many results (sorted by relevancy) are shown
1. `excluded_decks`: if you don't want notes from some decks to show up in the search results, add these decks here. Accepts a comma-separated list of deck names (case-sensitive!). E.g. `["deck 1", "parent deck::child deck"]`

### current caveats
1. might not work super well for chinese, japanese and similar languages 
1. highlighting won't work in all cases
1. if you add a note, it won't appear in the search results until you restart Anki
