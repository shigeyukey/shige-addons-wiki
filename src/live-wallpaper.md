Display live wallpapers for Anki. Support for Home, Reviewer, Overview, and Congrats. The wallpaper video includes 18 types. 


## How to use

* The add-on will be automatically activated after download, the video can be changed optionally.
* To reduce the load on Anki, the video quality is a bit low. (720p 1280 × 720)
* To reduce the load on Anki, if no action is taken in Anki for over 10 seconds, playback will auto stop. When Anki is interacted with, playback will resume.

## Video playback issues

Video playback is relatively high load for Anki so this is a relatively fragile add-on, some devices may not work at all.

When playing videos for a long time, sometimes the video crashes and Anki's performance becomes extremely slow. (Anki and GPU disconnect) If this occurs please restart Anki. There is an add-on available to quickly restart Anki.
* addon: [🔂AnkiRestart V2 - Quick Anki Rebooter](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1766024579)

If crashes occur frequently, changing the video driver in Anki's Preferences may help.

* Tools -> Preferences (Ctrl+P) -> Video driver

After changing the video driver, please restart Anki. Probably the video driver needs to be set to something other than Software. (Software mode does not use the GPU and is very slow, so it cannot play videos.)

If your PC does not have a basic GPU built in for some reason or if you can only use software, this add-on will likely not work. (this issue is a physical limitation of the GPU so it cannot be resolved by the add-on.)

### Blur Main
Set the blur for the main window.

### Blur Top and Bottom
Set the blur for the top toolbar and bottom bar.

### Texture Opacity
By default, the video displays the iron plate texture as semi transparent. Setting this to 0 will hide it.
