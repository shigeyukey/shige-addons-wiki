Add a blur effect to the background of the deck table on Anki's home screen. (also make the top toolbar transparent.) e.g.

## How to use

After download the add-on and restart Anki it will be auto enabled.

There is a feature to make buttons transparent using the same method, but this feature is likely to interfere with other button add-ons so it is disabled by default. You can enable it in the config.

## Config

* `is_addon_enable` Toggle the add-on on and off. value: `true` or `false`
* `is_enable_button`: Toggle button blur on and off. value: `true` or `false`
* `is_enable_top_toolbar` Toggle top toolbar blur on and off. value: `true` or `false`
* `is_enable_deck_blur` Toggle Anki Home deck table blur on and off. value: `true` or `false`

## Note

* This add-on does not have a wallpaper feature.
* On some devices blur may cause flickering or performance degradation, this is why the official Anki developers haven't added it.
