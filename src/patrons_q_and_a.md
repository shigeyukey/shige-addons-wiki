### Q. How can I get Patrons only add-ons?
If you support my volunteer development on Patreon you can download all Patrons only add-ons. ($5/month): [Patreon: Shigeyuki](https://www.patreon.com/Shigeyuki)


### Q. What is Patreon?
Patreon is a popular platform for fans to support creators. It has useful features such as creator and fan interaction, content distribution, and a refund system. Patreon help and support is also available so it is easier and safer than dealing directly with fans and creators.


### Q. How do I install Patrons only add-ons?

The basic mechanism is the same as the free add-ons on AnkiWeb. You can install them by downloading the ".addons" file from a patreon post, then double-clicking it and downloading it to Anki. Updating add-ons is the same procedure.

### Q. What devices and versions are supported?
I support the latest Anki, Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you have any problems please contact me as I will add new support.

### Q. What if add-ons does not work as expected?

If add-ons do not work as expected, please request a repair or improvement, or request a refund.

### Q. I paid by mistake, can I get a refund?

If it is within 3 months of payment, Patreon's feature allows me to refund you quickly. Please contact me via direct message on Patreon.

If you have paid incorrectly for more than 3 months (e.g. completely forgot to cancel), we need some other refund way, in this case please contact me.

### Q. Is it legal to buy and sell Anki add-ons?

Yes, Anki's add-ons are allowed to be sold if the license is properly observed (AGPL). And all pixel art used in Patreon's add-ons, such as game characters, are purchased by me, or are licensed for commercial use by creators, or are original illustrations that I drew myself. BGM, etc. are the same.
