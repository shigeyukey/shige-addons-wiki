<!-- ## 💡Frequently Asked Questions


**Q. How do I contact Shigeyuki?**

If you can send it to me it doesn't matter where you contact me from. If you have error reports please send them to me.

### Q. Do you accept work requests for Anki add-ons development?

A. My development is a hobby so I am not accepting work requests. Requests for free ideas are always accepted. -->

<!-- ### Q. Can I hire you for my project?

A. Not accepted. I'm more like an employer than an employee so if you want to hire me for your project I also want to hire you for my game addons project.

### Q. How can I get my request developed as quickly as you can?

A. I do not know until I develop it. If it is easy it can be done within a few days, if it is difficult it can take about 6 months or more. Basically it is common for development to take several months or more even for simple tasks. -->
