### 2. Example of counts
Current setting is 10, so reviewing 10 cards will fill the second progress bar.  
(The numbers in this image have been edited for clarity and are different from the actual display.)

For example, if the number of cards due today is 80,  
and the small chunk is 10, the large chunk is 8.

Small Chunk can be set to a maximum of 100.  
 If the cards due today are 1300, and the small chunk is 100, the large chunk is 13.
