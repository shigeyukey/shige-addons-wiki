### Always play ambient sound

### All BGM Enable or Disable

1. Completely disables or enables all sound functions. To enable this function it is necessary to restart Anki.

   * If you cannot activate it completely you can disable it manually by setting ‚Äúall_bgm_enable‚Äù to `false` from add-on config: `"all_bgm_enable" : false,`
