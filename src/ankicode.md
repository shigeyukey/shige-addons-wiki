\>*An add-on that utilizes the pypresence library and updates your Discord status (Rich Presence) to display your Anki activity.*

This add-on is a customized version(fork) for Anki24+ of a discontinued development Ankicord, most of the code is credited to the author, STadas.

 **📖How to use :** <br>
 1. You only need to install the Add-on to use it, no initial setup is required. (Discord must be downloaded to your PC)
 1. You can customize it with Config: Tools -> Add-ons -> Select Ankicord -> Config

<br>

 **Note:**<br>
 1. The code has been partially updated but functionally it is the same as the original add-on for now. This add-on is similar to Leaderboard so I want to enhance it later.
