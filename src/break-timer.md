1. After reviewing 10 cards, it auto-hides Anki and shows it after 3 minutes. (Customizable)
2. A timer will appear during the break, you can stop the timer by right-clicking on it.
3.  Press “Start Break Timer” on the menu bar to start the timer counting now.

This add-on idea was inspired by add-on [Ruzu Pop-ups](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1736169259).

# Option

## Count tab

![alt text](https://shigeyukey.github.io/shige-addons-wiki/images/break-timer/00.png)

### Target Cards

Specify the target number of cards. According to gamification researchers 5 to 20 is effective for motivation.

### Now Reviewed Cards

Adjust the current count of reviewed cards. e.g. Setting it to 0 resets the count.


### Count Enable or Diable

Disables the card counting feature.

### Actions

Set actions to run when card counting is done.

1. Start Break Timer
2. Hide Anki
2. Sync Anki

3. Open Leaderboard: addon: [🏆Anki Leaderboard](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/175794613)
    Opens the add-on's leaderboard window. 

4. Restart Anki: add-on: [🔂AnkiRestart V2](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1766024579)

    This feature is for developers (me), not general learners. Developers typically need to restart Anki to check add-on functionality, so it's intended for me to review while writing code. e.g.
      1. Write add-on code.
      2. Review in Anki.
      3. Auto restart Anki.
      4. Check the add-on's behavior.
      5. Repeat.



## Break timer tab

### Break Timer

Set the duration for the break timer. Minimum 1 minute, maximum 60 minutes.

### Opacity

Set the timer's transparency, 0 is transparent and 10 is non-transparent.

### Hide Break Timer

Completely hide the timer.


### Shortcut

Set a shortcut key to run the break timer. If the key doesn't work it may be conflicting with keys from other add-ons if so please try another key.



## Other tab

### Do not show in menu bar

Hide BreakTimer menu from the Anki menu bar.

### Hide addon name

Hide the text “BreakTimer” displayed in the menu bar.

### Not Focus to Avoid Mistyping

If Anki reappears while you're typing, you might accidentally answer a card. (e.g. Accidentally pressing the spacebar or Enter key) To avoid this issue, there's a feature that disables Anki's focus and key input when Anki reappears, this option disables it.

### Reset Timer positions

Reset the timer position. (e.g. the BreakTimer is outside the display and cannot be operated.)

### Stop Auto Answer

When using the auto-answer feature, hiding Anki causes reviews to continue automatically. These options stop such reviews.

#### Stop Speed Focus Mode

Stop the add-on's Speed Focus Mode add-on when starting the timer.

#### Stop Auto Advance

Stop Anki's native Auto Advance feature when starting the timer.

## Tips

### Ensure Anki's Window Redisplay


Occasionally when the timer ends Anki's window may not regain focus and fail to display properly. To avoid this problem try using the add-on Always On Top.

 * addon: [🔝Always On Top - permanently keep Anki as top](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1045980020)


### Small Window (or Full screen)

If you want to display Anki as small as possible like Ruzu popups, you can use the No Distractions Full Screen add-on option. like this:

* addon: [🖥️No Distractions Full Screen ](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1370336700)(ND Full Screen menu -> Windowed Mode\[ON])

### Small text size (or Large)

If you want to reduce the text size try using the Zoom add-on.

 *  addon: [🔍️Zoom for Anki24 - Keep zoom level after reboot](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1923741581)
