* After reviewing 10 cards, it auto-hides Anki and shows it after 3 minutes. (Customizable)
* A timer will appear during the break, you can stop the timer by right-clicking on it.
* Press “Start Break Timer” on the menu bar to start the timer counting now.
* This Add-on idea was inspired by ruzu_pop_ups.
