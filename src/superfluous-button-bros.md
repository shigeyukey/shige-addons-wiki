This add-on is still in development and not yet complete, so it is not published on Anki Web. If you become a Patreon, you will get early access to beta versions that are in development. (Operation is not guaranteed)

##  === Description ===
This is an add-on under development to add superfluous buttons to Anki.(Works only on PC). It is also the third prototype add-on Gamification for Studying I have made. It is still under development, so the operation is a little unstable.

There are two button types, "gumi" and "fps", which can be changed in the settings. Each button illustration was created by me based on the material.

The default is "gumi".  The "fps" type is intended to be used in combination with Doomanki, an add-on I have developed previously. (Doomanki is still unstable, so I am refactoring it.)


##  === How to Use ===
- Pressing the answer button while a question is being displayed will display the answer. 

- Press and hold for more than 0.5 seconds to cancel the click.

- Right-click on a question and set it to "moveable" to change its position freely.  If the button is set to "freeze," it will automatically return to its original position. There is no function yet to batch restore the position of a button. (So, if the button is completely off the screen, you will need to restart Anki :P)

- You can show or hide the default answer buttons in the settings. 

- The buttons will be hidden when the focus is removed from the window. (e.g. Open Edit or Browse)



## === Other ===
-If you like this add-on and need more development, and free version, press the heart button or high rating. Enjoy Studying with Anki!
