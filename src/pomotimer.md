This add-on is a new Pomodoro timer add-on based on my previous timer. Circular progress bar with transparent background.

(Study 25 min → Rest 5 min) x 4 sets → Rest 15 min

* Drag and drop to move.

* Display timer when Anki starts up.

* auto stop : When the timer ends, the speed focus or auto advance is auto stopped. This feature is intended to avoid cards being auto answered while a pop-up is displayed.

* Accelerated Timer Mode (for Debugging) : Set the timer to 100x speed. You can use it to check the operation.

* Adjust values manually : Click on tomatoes or a number to manually adjust the count.

    * Tomatoes : Counts pomodoro up to 4.

    * Number : Counts the total number of pomodoro.
