### What is Anki-tan?

Anki-tan is a doodle I drew for [April fool's day this year(2025, reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1joswls/today_april_1st_is_magical_girl_ankitans_12th/). (Nothing to do with official Anki!) To be frank I was too lazy to draw it so the next appearance was scheduled for April 1 next year, but some Anki users requested me so I added it a bit more. The next appearance is still undecided. It's inspired by [Wikipe-tan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipe-tan) and [Anki's fan art](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/gt3zcb/made_an_anki_fanart_to_express_my_gratitude/).

This add-on does not exist because I drew it on April Fool's Day.

(*This Leech-tan was drawn on April Fool's Day, 2025, so it is not 2022. She is pretending to exist from 2022!)
