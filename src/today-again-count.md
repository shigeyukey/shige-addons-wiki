# TodayAgainCount
Anki's add-on to display today's Again count in menu bar for each card


## Description

- [again] Number of times you have pressed Again in a row today for the current card. When you press Hard/Good/Easy, it returns to 0.
- [lapse] If you press Good and then Again, the number of Laps will increase. But the first Again doesn't count. 
- [graduate] Number of consecutive correct answers so far(not just today)

You can change the settings. I think it might be better to exclude Hard, it is off by default.
