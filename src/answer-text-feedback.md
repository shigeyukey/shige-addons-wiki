In the reviewer, display text animation feedback based on your answers. There are features to display card type, due date, and ease (or difficulty). (This add-on is an improved and enhanced version of the Ease Scouter I previously developed.)


# How to use

The add-on will activate automatically after installation, and text feedback will be displayed when you review.

## Options

Text feedback can be customized with options. This option can be accessed from the add-ons menu. (Anki Menu -> Tools -> Anser text feedback)
