# An-Ki-Oh! - Anki Card  Template \[Prototype]

## === Description ===
I made a video on how to use this template. Please check it.

Although I forgot to mention it in the video, there is a feature to play slide-in and flip sounds. However, this feature does not work on AnkiWeb since it does not support autoplay. It should work otherwise.
