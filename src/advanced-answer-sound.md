### Notes
1. This add-on is designed to play various sounds and background music, so when you install it sounds and BGM will auto play. If you don't like the sound, BGM, or volume, you can customize them in the options. (Menu -> Tools -> Advanced Answer Sound)
1. If the sound does not auto play there may be a bug, if so please contact me.
1. Mac and Linux should work but I have not confirmed this yet, if it does not work please contact me.
