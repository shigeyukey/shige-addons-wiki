[![reddit](https://github.com/shigeyukey/AnkiRestart/assets/124401518/85368aad-6f50-4335-8858-7a30a66fb065)](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shige-yuki)<br>

This add-on is for add-on developers, not for general learners. It displays debug info directly and makes errors easier to read. (It does nothing unless an error occurs.)

## 📖How to Use
1. Default debug info is not displayed.
1. Add-ons info is not displayed.
1. Font size and colors can be customized in Config.
1. When you resize the window the size is auto saved.

## Avoid Anki freeze
1. If the same error occurs continuously due to an infinite loop, etc., the popup is stopped and a tooltip is displayed.
2. If there are three or more error windows a new window will not be created.<br>
