# ⚙️Meta json Formatter

This add-on is for add-on developers, not for general learners. When "meta.json (add-ons config)" is saved it is automatically formatted to make the code easier to read.

## Note
* This add-on has only been tested with Anki24.11. If a problem occurs config may not be able to be saved.
