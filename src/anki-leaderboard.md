# 📖How to use

1. This add-on ranks all of its users by the number of cards reviewed today, time spend studying today, current streak, reviews in the past 31 days, and retention.
1. You can also compete against friends, join groups, and join a country leaderboard.
1. You'll only see users, that synced on the same day as you.
<br>

## 🏆League
1. In the league tab, you see everyone who synced at least once during the current season. There are four leagues. (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta)
1. The top 20% will be promoted, and the bottom 20% will be demoted. (Start -> Delta -> Gamma -> Beta -> Alpha)
<br>

## 📅Season (League)
1. A season lasts two weeks. You don't have to sync every day. For now I have it set to tally after 3 days and start a new league on the next Monday. (Because of time zone differences between countries and the time it takes mobile users to sync leagues on their PC)
<br>

## 👥Group
1.  By default, there are public groups for Medicine, Language, and Pokemon. (password 1234)<br>
1.  If you want to delete the group, please contact me.<br>
1.  If you do not set a password, an error will occur. If anyone can enter, please include the pass in your group name.<br>
<br>

## 📈XP formula
1. <code>XP = days studied percentage x ((6 x time) + (2 x reviews x retention)) </code>

1. You have to study at least 5 minutes per day. Otherwise, this day won't be counted as “studied”
(<i><a href="https://github.com/ThoreBor/Anki_Leaderboard/issues/122">See this issue for more info</a></i>).
1. At the end of each season, the top 20% will be promoted, and the last 20% will be relegated.
<br>
