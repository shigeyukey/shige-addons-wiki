# 📖How to use

1. This add-on ranks all of its users by the number of cards reviewed today, time spend studying today, current streak, reviews in the past 31 days, and retention.
1. You can also compete against friends, join groups, and join a country leaderboard.
1. You'll only see users, that synced on the same day as you.
<br>

## 🏆League
1. In the league tab, you see everyone who synced at least once during the current season. There are four leagues. (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta)
1. The top 20% will be promoted, and the bottom 20% will be demoted. (Start -> Delta -> Gamma -> Beta -> Alpha)
<br>

## 📅Season (League)
1. A season lasts two weeks. You don't have to sync every day. For now I have it set to tally after 3 days and start a new league on the next Monday. (Because of time zone differences between countries and the time it takes mobile users to sync leagues on their PC)
<br>

## 👥Group
1.  By default, there are public groups for Medicine, Language, and Pokemon. (password 1234)<br>
1.  If you want to delete the group, please contact me.<br>
1.  If you do not set a password, an error will occur. If anyone can enter, please include the pass in your group name.<br>

## 🤝Friends
* You can add users to friends and display them like a group.
They will not be notified of your name.
<br>


## 🗝️Account
* You can Sign-up, Log-in, Delete account, Log-out, Change user name, and Bio.
* Do not use anything in your name or Bio that would be offensive to other users.
<br>

## 📈XP formula
1. <code>XP = days studied percentage x ((6 x time) + (2 x reviews x retention)) </code>

1. You have to study at least 5 minutes per day. Otherwise, this day won't be counted as “studied”
(<i><a href="https://github.com/ThoreBor/Anki_Leaderboard/issues/122" target="_blank">See this issue for more info</a></i>).
1. At the end of each season, the top 20% will be promoted, and the last 20% will be relegated.
<br>

# ❓️Frequently Asked Questions

### Q. Can I show the leaderboard without opening the add-on window?
* The leaderboard can be displayed in Anki's Home by Config. (Leaderboard Config -> Settings -> Home screen -> Show the home screen leaderboard)

### Q. How do I show the leaderboard after the review is finished?
* This feature is not yet available, you can sync when the review is finished by Config. (Leaderboard Config -> Settings -> General -> Sync when deck is finished)
* You can open the leaderboard with a shortcut key. (Shift + L)


### Q. Login keeps failing and sync is not finished, what should I do?

* Sometimes bad internet communication can prevent the connection, please try again later.
* It may work if you remove the add-on and reinstall it.

### Q. A user is cheating, what should I do?

This may not be a cheat because people use Anki in different ways, e.g.
* Review time is too fast: The learner may be using Anki's option to shorten the time to record.
* Retention is too high : The learner may be reviewing a batch of cards before the exam.

If you find such users distracting, please hide them. (Double click on user name -> Hide user)


### Q. How do I delete a group?
* The function to delete a group is not yet developed, please contact me.

### Q. When will the new league start?
* For now I have it set to tally after 3 days and start a new league on the next Monday. Because of time zone differences between countries and the time it takes mobile users to sync leagues on their PC.
