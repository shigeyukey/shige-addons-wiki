### ---! Attention ! & Introduction---
This add-on is still in development and not yet complete, so it is not published on Anki Web. If you become a Patreon, you will get early access to beta versions that are in development. (Operation is not guaranteed)

(My patreon add-ons will be released for free in the future. I will develop add-ons exclusively for Patreon first, and then release the free version. If you want it for free, please follow me and wait.)

I think it should probably work on Mac, Linux, Anki 2.1.43?~Anki 2.1.61, and Qt6 & Qt5. But I haven't checked others yet. It works on my PC Windows, Anki 2.1.61, Qt6.

(Anki add-ons only work on PC. It does not work on smartphones Anki Mobile or AnkiDroid.)
