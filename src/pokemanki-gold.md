# 📖How to use
*(Some of these descriptions are based on the original Pokemanki description.)*

* Pokemanki gives you a Pokemon (or an egg which will hatch into a Pokemon) for each lowest-level deck (deck without sub-decks) in your collection that you have started learning. As you learn and review the cards in that deck, your Pokemon will level up and may even evolve!
* For larger decks, it takes longer until the first Pokemon hatches.

# 💡Frequently Asked Questions

---

### Q. When I start Anki it is still loading and I cannot operate Anki.

New version has been added to show Pokemon in Home when Anki is launched, so if your deck is too large this may be causing an error (so far this problem seems to be very rare). In this case I think you can turn off all the functions to display in Home from Config.

please try this:

1. Start Anki while holding down the Shift key (all add-ons will be disabled).
2. With Anki in safe mode open the Config of the add-ons
	* Tools -> Add-ons -> Select Pokemanki Gold -> Config
3. Overwrite Config with this text and save it:

```
{
    "Number of deck name splits": 3,
    "PokeType": true,
    "X_or_Y_mega_evolutions": "X",
    "align_cards": "scrollbox",
    "auto_open_trade": false,
    "gen2": true,
    "gen3": true,
    "gen4": true,
    "gen4_evolutions": true,
    "gen5": true,
    "is_change_log_2024_03_26": true,
    "is_rate_this": true,
    "max_height_px": "500",

    "show_pokemon_in_reviewer": false,
    "hide_pokeball_in_toolbar": true,
    "Show Pokemon in Home and overview": false,
    "auto_open_trade": false
}
```
4. Restart Anki.
5. All Pokemanki options that run when Anki starts will be turned off.
