# 📖How to use
*(Some of these descriptions are based on the original Pokemanki description.)*


* Pokemanki gives you a Pokemon (or an egg which will hatch into a Pokemon) for each lowest-level deck (deck without sub-decks) in your collection that you have started learning. As you learn and review the cards in that deck, your Pokemon will level up and may even evolve!
* For larger decks, it takes longer until the first Pokemon hatches.


<br>

## 📊Show your Pokemon

1. **📊Stats :** Open Anki's Statistics (Stats) to see the Pokemon in the current deck. Select "Collection" and you should see the Pokemon for all decks.
2. **🏠️Home and OverView :** Show Pokemon in Anki's home and Overview, this function can be optionally disabled. (e.g. if your deck takes a long time to load turn it off.)

<br>

### 🤝Today's Trades
<!-- ﾎﾟｹﾓﾝの交換 -->
1.  You can randomly trade 3 Pokemon every day.
1.  Option to auto open the trade window when Anki is launched.
