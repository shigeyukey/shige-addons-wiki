### 1. Fade in/out  
There is a fade and fade out function when you hide Anki. But this function may not work outside of Windows. (I have tested it on Mac and Linux and it causes flickering.)

### 2. Hide Anki & Speed Focus Mode  
If you use speed focus mode, there is a problem with the card auto advancing when you hide Anki. In this case, activate the setting to auto stop speed focus. This setting can be found in the Other tab, under Advanced.
