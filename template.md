## 📥 How do I install this add-on?

1. This add-on works with Anki for desktop (it does not work on mobile). Download Anki from the [official website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) if you haven't already.
2. Copy and paste the add-on code ( `🟢` )  into Anki and you can install it. ( *Menu -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Code \[ add-on code ]* )
3. When I develop bug fixes, create new features, or compatibility for New Anki, I will notify you and you can install it.
4. Add-ons will be broken when the official Anki gets a major update, so if you like this add-on please support my volunteer development by rating, sharing, and donating. Thank you!
