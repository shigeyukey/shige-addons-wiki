## 📥 How do I install this add-on?
1. Copy and paste the add-on code ( `🟢` )  into Anki and you can install it. ( *Menu -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Code \[ add-on code ]* )
2. When I develop bug fixes, create new features, or compatibility for New Anki, I will notify you and you can install it.
3. If you rate and recommend it, I will receive a notice and my tedious and sleepy add-ons volunteer work will become more enjoyable and exciting. (This add-on is developed by free volunteer work!👍️)
